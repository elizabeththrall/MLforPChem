This repository contains materials for machine learning regression analysis of cyanine dye electronic absorption spectra:
1. Computational notebooks, both student and instructor versions (in Python and Mathematica)
2. An example dataset containing 147 cyanine dyes, with 13 molecular features and the wavelength of maximum absorption
3. A student handout and example protocol for performing the analysis in a physical chemistry lab course
