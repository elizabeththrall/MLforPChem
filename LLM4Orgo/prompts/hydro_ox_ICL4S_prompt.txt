Hydroboration Oxidation - In-context learning - 4 examples - SMILES
(* Below are four examples of a hydroboration oxidation reaction.  
CCC=C -> CCCCO,
CCC1=CCCCC1 -> CCC1(O)CCCCC1,
CC=CC -> CCC(C)O,
C1=CCCCC1 -> OC1CCCCC1.
Given the examples above, solve the following hydroboration oxidation reaction problem.*)
