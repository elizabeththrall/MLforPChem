This repository contains materials for machine learning classification analysis of infrared (IR) absorption spectra:
1. Computational notebooks, both student and instructor versions (in Python and Mathematica)
2. Example training and test datasets containing IR spectra of 2,337 molecules (separate versions for binary vs. multiclass classification analysis) as well as a  "bad" dataset of improperly formatted data
3. A student handout and example protocol for performing the analysis in a physical chemistry lab course
